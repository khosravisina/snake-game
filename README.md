# snake-game
This repository contains the code for a simple snake game written in Python using the Turtle library and object-oriented programming (OOP). The game is controlled using the arrow keys, and the goal is to eat as many food items as possible without hitting the wall or itself.

The game uses OOP to implement the snake as a class. The snake class has attributes for the snake's position, heading, and segments. The class also has methods for moving the snake, drawing the snake, and detecting collisions.

The game also uses the Turtle library to draw the snake and the food items. The Turtle library provides a simple way to draw shapes and move objects on the screen.

This game is a good example of how to use OOP and the Turtle library to create simple games in Python. I created this game as part of the 100 Days of Code course, and I learned a lot about Python programming and game development in the process.

The change I made to this code is that the snake's speed increases as the score increases, making the game more difficult.


I hope you enjoy playing my snake game!
